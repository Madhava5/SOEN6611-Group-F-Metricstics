# METRICSTICS

Welcome to METRICSTICS, a robust system designed for computing descriptive statistics with a focus on measures of central tendency, frequency, and variability. This project aims to provide a versatile toolkit for analyzing data, whether sourced from real-world data sets or artificially generated through random data generators.

## Key Features
- **Minimum (m) and Maximum (M):** METRICSTICS efficiently identifies the smallest and largest values within the given data set.
- **Mode (o):** The system determines the mode, representing the most frequently occurring value(s).
- **Median (d):** METRICSTICS calculates the middle number for odd-sized data sets and the mean of two middle numbers for even-sized sets.
- **Arithmetic Mean (μ):** The system computes the average using the sum of all values divided by the number of data points.
- **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):** METRICSTICS evaluates the average absolute deviation of each data point from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** The system measures the spread of data by calculating the square root of the average squared deviations from the mean.
